                    <br>
                    <p>In traditional manufacturering, technology has made
                        printers faster and more efficient, allowing for
                        qicker printing and reducing waiting time. with
                        advancements in technology, printers can now produce
                        higher-quality prints with sharper images and more
                        flashy color.<p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Many printers now come with eco-friendly
                                features, such as energy-saving modes and
                                the ability to print on recycled paper.
                                These options help minimize the
                                environmental impact of printing.</p>

                            <h2>Negative impact of technology on
                                printer</h2>
                            <p>With the increasing use of technology, there
                                are more opportunities for our personal
                                information to be compromised. It's
                                important to be cautious and protect our
                                privacy online.Technology has made it easier
                                to connect with others, but it can also lead
                                to a sense of isolation. Spending too much
                                time on screens can reduce face-to-face
                                interactions and affect our social

                                expensive, making them less accessible to
                                everyone. While there are eco-friendly
                                printers available, the manufacturing and
                                disposal of printers can still have an
                                environmental impact due to the use of
                                materials and electronic waste.</p>
